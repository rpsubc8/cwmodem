# cwmodem
<h1>hamradio tools</h1>

Experimental ultra narrow band modem to send data over radio via cw (morse) audio to low speed.
Designed for excessively long distances and very low speed (50 baud) and power (qrp).
In the chat mode, 5 bits of coding are used for each letter (data packaging), as well as the use of dictionaries to compress the data.<br><br>
